# Method of measurement

My original idea was around making a _continuous_ series of photos of a section of a laminar flow of air containing pollen particles. Pollen particles should be illuminated by a strong light source in otherwise dark ambient conditions so that they appear as light blobs in the dark to the camera. 

I had my master's thesis around detecting pathologic blood cells in the blood sample by processing the microphotographs, first detecting cells and their form/color, and then processing with algorithms. That was quite successful. So I want to use the same method on pollen - detect single pollen particles in the air and then classify them by size, form, etc.

Processing passing air requires no obvious spares, so it should be [low maintenance](project_goals.md#maintainability). Of course, some periodic cleaning of the insides from dust and pollen and changing coarse air filters (blocking poplar fluff and alike) may be required yearly or 2-3 per year. 

To be continued...
