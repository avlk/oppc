# Open Pollen Particle Counter

This site describes my journey in developing a pollen particle detector. The detector is meant to be relatively inexpensive and buildable by a DIY-er out in the city or area where it is needed.

The purpose of a pollen particle counter is to count the content of pollen particles of different species of pollen in ambient air. This project aims to do all the counting in an automated way, with no daily maintenance, and provide the data to the cloud where it can be used for alerting, statistics, and some apps. 

Pollen allergy is very common, a lot of people are suffering from it, and when the species they are sensitive to starts blooming, they need to take medications, wear a really serious protective face mask, refrain from going out of their house, or even travel to another region. Many of the travelers to the sea or mountains in the low season (when the sea is cold, pools are closed, and no skiing in the mountains is possible) are the allergic person or their family. 

Allergic persons closely monitor information sources on pollen content in the air to know when they need to refrain from traveling to the office, wear a mask, or even flee from the pollen to another region. 

In some areas, like in the EU, pollen monitoring is set to a very high standard, with lots of monitoring stations, sometimes automated, sometimes requiring manual labor, providing information to the people. In other areas, actually most of the world, there are no pollen monitoring stations or just several for the area of millions sq.km. This is not enough and therefore there is no information on the pollen - this is what this project will try to change.
